% Here are some instructions for modifying or extending this file.  This
% file is used by many people, for many existing latex documents.  This
% file is used by people all over the world, and has been used for many
% years.  It therefore very important that your changes do not break
% these existing documents.  Thank you.
%
%
%
% Here are the important rules.  If you break them, people will become
% angry.
%
% -- Never remove an entry.  If you don't want people to use a certain
%    entry any more, add a comment in front of it stating so.  If you
%    remove an entry, existing papers won't latex any more.
%
% -- Never remove fields from entries.  Someone may need this field, and
%    the generated reference is then missing critical information.
%    Worse, that may go unnoticed for a long time, e.g. when a revised
%    version is sent to the referee.
%
% -- If you add an entry, make sure it is properly placed and in the
%    expected alphabetical order.
%
% -- Although many possible conventions are possible (and used!) for the
%    citation field, you are encouraged to use something which is human
%    readable, eg article{Einstein1905. ADS- or Spires-like conventions,
%    on the other had, are deprecated.
%
%    outdated, e.g. because they have been published, or they contain an
%    error, or you have additional information for that entry (e.g. an
%    eprint number or a URL).  It is okay to change a references
%    substantially when a preprint has been published.
%
% -- If an entry doesn't look nice in your references, don't change the
%    entry just to make it look nice.  It is likely that your changes
%    will make it look ugly for other people.  Instead, change your
%    bibtex style, or create your own.  (This is easy; see
%    <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeXfor instructions.)
%
% -- If you absolutely cannot live with an existing entry, then
%    duplicate it with a new name.  This is an ugly solution, but at
%    least it guarantees that you don't break anything.  Please add a
%    comment describing the differences, or telling people which entry
%    to use in general.
%
% -- Do not add new fields to entries that will dramatically change how
%    these entries are printed.  For example, the "note" field is always
%    printed, which means that you should only put information there
%    that is always interesting -- even in a PRL where every line
%    counts.  Do not use the "note" field to add some information that
%    belongs into other fields, e.g. "eprint".  If you want to see
%    eprint numbers, you can change bibtex style instead (see above).
%
% -- In general, do not add a "key" field to your entries.  The "key"
%    field is definitely not meant to be a repetition of the key (the
%    thingy you use in the \cite command).  Instead, the "key" field is
%    e.g. used to sort entries when no author is specified.  Some bibtex
%    styles also output the key into the reference (i.e., they generate
%    "[key]" instead of "[42]" in the paper.  Unless you really want to
%    use this feature, don't add keys.  Especially don't add keys with
%    underscores, which lead to latex errors.
%
% -- In spite of the above, please do update references that are
%    outdated, e.g. because they have been published, or they contain an
%    error, or you have additional information for that entry (e.g. an
%    eprint number or a URL).  It is okay to change a references
%    substantially when a preprint has been published.
%
%
%
% And here are some rules of minor importance.
%
% - If you want to add an eprint number, use an "eprint" field.
%
% - If you want to add a URL, use a "url" field.  URLs in "url" fields
%   do not need to be quoted in any way.  If you add URLs pointing
%   to arxiv.org, note that they request that you point to the paper's
%   abstract, not directly to the PDF document.  You may need to use
%   "\usepackage{url}" for these urls, or you may need to update your
%   bibtex style.  However, URLs printed from the "url" field look much
%   nicer.  They can even have line breaks.
%
% - We usually create keys of the form "last name of first author",
%   "year", "letter".  Examples are "Abel97a" or "Abbott:2006vg".  Try
%   to follow a similar rule.  Don't make the key too long.
%
% - Try to avoid adding one-time entries, e.g. for "private
%   communication".  Consider instead using a second bibtex file that
%   is distributed with your paper.  You can use several bibtex files
%   together by listing them all in the same \bibliography command,
%   separated by commas, without spaces.
%
% - Keep the entries sorted.  (I don't know why I have to mention this
%   here, but it seems to be necessary.  Maybe it helps.)
%
% - Before you commit, run bibtex at least once to make sure that there
%   are no errors.  (This should also go without saying.)
%
% - If you find yourself using bibtex a lot, consider reading some
%   documentation, e.g. starting from <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX>.



% These are the journal abbreviations that the ADS systems uses for its bibtex references;
% add them to your tex file if you want to be able to use references
% that uses bibtex references from ADS; the recommendation however is that you do
% not use abbrevioationsL. Rezzolla Thu Oct  8 10:14:16 CEST 2009

We show that conformal invariance imposes powerful constraints on the form of the second-order corrections. By matching to the AdS/CFT calculations of correlators, and to recent results for Bjorken flow obtained by Heller and Janik, we find three (out of five) second-order transport coefficients in the strongly coupled 𝒩 = 4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. We also discuss how these new coefficents can arise within the kinetic theory of weakly coupled conformal plasmas. We point out that the Müller-Israel-Stewart theory, often used in numerical simulations, does not contain all allowed second-order terms and, frequently, terms required by conformal invariance.}

These include the Tucson and isobar intermediate-state models of the two-pion exchange TNI. The latter is also studied with an intermediate-range three-nucleon repulsion. In general, realistic TNI helps to bring the theory closer to experiment by giving extra binding energy to the A = 3 and 4 nuclei and providing extra saturation to the nuclear matter binding energy. The Coulomb energy of 3He and the rms radii of A = 3, 4 nuclei are also well described. However, some problems remain unresolved. There is a slight overbinding of 4He, an underbinding of nuclear matter, and the charge form factors of 3He and 4He, calculated with impulse approximation, deviate from the experimental at q2>5 fm−2."

abstract="We review the traditional derivation of the fluid-dynamical equations from kinetic theory according to Israel and Stewart. We show that their procedure to close the fluid-dynamical equations of motion is not unique. Their approach contains two approximations, the first being the so-called 14-moment approximation to truncate the single-particle distribution function. The second consists in the choice of equations of motion for the dissipative currents. Israel and Stewart used the second moment of the Boltzmann equation, but this is not the only possible choice. In fact, there are infinitely many moments of the Boltzmann equation which can serve as equations of motion for the dissipative currents. All resulting equations of motion have the same form, but the transport coefficients are different in each case.",

    abstract = { We consider a first-order formulation of relativistic fluids with bulk viscosity based on a stress-energy tensor introduced by Lichnerowicz. Choosing a barotropic equation-of-state, we show that this theory satisfies basic physical requirements and, under the further assumption of vanishing vorticity, that the equations of motion are causal, both in the case of a fixed background and when the equations are coupled to Einstein's equations. Furthermore, Lichnerowicz's proposal does not fit into the general framework of first-order theories studied by Hiscock and Lindblom, and hence their instability results do not apply. These conclusions apply to the full-fledged nonlinear theory, without any equilibrium or near equilibrium assumptions. Similarities and differences between the approach explored here and other theories of relativistic viscosity, including the Mueller–Israel–Stewart formulation, are addressed. Cosmological models based on the Lichnerowicz stress-energy tensor are studied. As the topic of (relativistic) viscous fluids is also of interest outside the general relativity and cosmology communities, such as, for instance, in applications involving heavy-ion collisions, we make our presentation largely self-contained. }

	abstract = {We perform long-term general relativistic neutrino radiation hydrodynamics simulations (in axisymmetry) for a massive neutron star (MNS) surrounded by a torus, which is a canonical remnant formed after the binary neutron star merger. We take into account the effects of viscosity, which is likely to arise in the merger remnant due to magnetohydrodynamical turbulence. The viscous effect plays key roles for the mass ejection from the remnant in two phases of the evolution. In the first t ≲ 10 ms, a differential rotation state of the MNS is changed to a rigidly rotating state. A shock wave caused by the variation of its quasi-equilibrium state induces significant mass ejection of mass ∼(0.5–2.0)  for the α-viscosity parameter of 0.01–0.04. For the longer-term evolution with ∼0.1–10 s, a significant fraction of the torus material is ejected. We find that the total mass of the viscosity-driven ejecta () could dominate over that of the dynamical ejecta (). The electron fraction, Y

e
, of the ejecta is always high enough (Y

e
 ≳ 0.25) that this post-merger ejecta is lanthanide-poor; hence, the opacity of the ejecta is likely to be ∼10–100 times lower than that of the dynamical ejecta. This indicates that the electromagnetic signal from the ejecta would be rapidly evolving, bright, and blue if it is observed from a small viewing angle (≲45°) for which the effect of the dynamical ejecta is minor.}

abstract="We study linearized stability in first-order relativistic viscous hydrodynamics in the most general frame. There is a region in the parameter space of transport coefficients where the perturbations of the equilibrium state are stable. This defines a class of stable frames, with the Landau-Lifshitz frame falling outside the class. The existence of stable frames suggests that viscous relativistic fluids may admit a sensible hydrodynamic description in terms of temperature, fluid velocity, and the chemical potential only, i.e. in terms of the same hydrodynamic variables as non-relativistic fluids. Alternatively, it suggests that the Israel-Stewart and similar constructions may be unnecessary for a sensible relativistic hydrodynamic theory.",

Writing down all terms in a gradient (long wavelength) expansion up to second order for a relativistic system at vanishing charge density, one obtains the most general (causal) equations of motion for a fluid in the presence of shear and bulk viscosity, as well as the structure of the non-equilibrium entropy current. Requiring positivity of the divergence of the non-equilibrium entropy current relates some of its coefficients to those entering the equations of motion. I comment on possible applications of these results for conformal and non-conformal fluids.}
